    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "ANS= MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented, NoSQL (non-relational) database that stores data in JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents.\n",
    "Each document can have its own unique structure, making it a flexible database for unstructured data.\n",
    "MongoDB is often used for handling big data, content management systems, and real-time web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use a traditional table-based schema.\n",
    "Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases can store and process unstructured data, which makes them ideal for handling large amounts of data that do not fit into a tabular format.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often used for real-time applications, big data analytics, and content management systems.\n",
    "They are also used in scenarios where data is constantly changing and updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where scalability and flexibility are important.\n",
    "MongoDB can easily handle unstructured and changing data, which makes it a great choice for real-time applications and content management systems.\n",
    "Additionally, MongoDB can scale horizontally and handle large amounts of data, making it a better choice for big data scenarios.\"\"\""

    "MongoDB has the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database. Data is stored in documents, which are JSON-like objects that can have their own unique structure.\n",
    "This allows for flexible and scalable data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB provides high availability with automatic failover and replication. This ensures that your data is always available, even in the event of hardware or software failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally and handle large amounts of data. This makes it a great choice for big data scenarios and high-traffic websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexes for faster querying and sorting of data. This makes it ideal for real-time applications and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB provides aggregation and map-reduce capabilities, which allow for advanced data analysis and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: MongoDB is very flexible and can handle unstructured data. This makes it ideal for real-time applications and content management systems.\"\"\""

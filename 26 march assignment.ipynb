    "#Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "\"\"\"Ans:-\n",
    "The main difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression lies in the number of independent variables (predictors) used to predict a dependent variable (target). Here's a detailed explanation and example of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Simple Linear Regression: Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable and a single dependent variable. It establishes a linear relationship between the two variables by fitting a straight line to the data. \n",
    "The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict a student's final exam score (dependent variable) based on the number of hours they studied (independent variable). We have a dataset with the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hours Studied\tFinal Exam Score\n",
    "    2                   60\n",
    "    4                   80\n",
    "    6                   90\n",
    "    8                   95\n",
    "Using simple linear regression, we can build a model that estimates the relationship between the number of hours studied and the final exam score. The resulting model equation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Exam Score = b0 + b1 * Hours Studied\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients (b0 and b1) of the equation can be estimated using methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The coefficient b1 represents the slope of the line and indicates the change in the final exam score for each additional hour studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables and a single dependent variable. It extends simple linear regression by considering the combined effect of multiple predictors on the target variable. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that minimizes the difference between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "Example of Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Let's consider the same scenario of predicting a student's final exam score but now including two additional independent variables: the number of hours slept the night before the exam and the previous test score. The dataset is expanded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hours Studied     Hours Slept Previous Test Score    Final Exam Score\n",
    "    \"2                7               75                60\n",

    "Using multiple linear regression, we can build a model that predicts the final exam score based on all three independent variables. The model equation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Exam Score = b0 + b1 * Hours Studied + b2 * Hours Slept + b3 * Previous Test Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, b3) represent the intercept and slopes of the corresponding independent variables. The coefficients indicate the change in the final exam score for a unit change in each independent variable, while holding the other variables constant.\n",

    "#Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?\n",
    "\"\"\"Ans:-Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the model. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This assumption assumes that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in each independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. There should be no correlation or relationship between the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) for different observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity refers to the constant variance of the residuals across all levels of the independent variables. This assumption implies that the spread of the residuals should be similar at all levels of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality: The residuals are normally distributed. This assumption assumes that the errors or residuals follow a normal distribution, which is necessary for conducting statistical inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No Multicollinearity: The independent variables used in the regression model are not highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following diagnostic tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Visualize Residuals: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. Check for patterns or trends in the residuals that violate the assumptions. If the residuals exhibit a non-linear pattern or a cone-shaped spread, it suggests violation of the linearity or homoscedasticity assumption, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Residual Analysis: Analyze the histogram or Q-Q plot of the residuals to assess their distribution. Deviations from normality indicate a violation of the normality assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Durbin-Watson Test: The Durbin-Watson test assesses the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals. Autocorrelation violates the independence assumption. A value close to 2 indicates no autocorrelation, while values significantly less than 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, and values greater than 2 suggest negative autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Calculate the VIF for each independent variable to assess multicollinearity. VIF measures the extent to which the variance of an estimated regression coefficient is increased due to collinearity. Higher VIF values indicate higher multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Box-Cox Transformation: If the residuals do not follow a normal distribution, you can apply a Box-Cox transformation to achieve normality.\"\"\""

    "Flexibility: Polynomial regression allows for more flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships between variables. It can capture curved or more complex patterns that linear regression cannot accommodate.\n",

Higher-degree polynomials can lead to models that are more difficult to interpret and can require more computational resources.\n",

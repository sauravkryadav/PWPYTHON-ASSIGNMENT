    "1.Central Limit Theorem: The normal distribution is a key component of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). According to the CLT,\n",

    "Many natural phenomena and human characteristics approximate a normal distribution, making it a useful tool for understanding and analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Statistical Inference: The normal distribution plays a crucial role in statistical inference. Many statistical methods and tests, such as hypothesis testing,\n",
    "confidence intervals, and regression analysis, assume the underlying distribution of the data to be normal. When data approximate a normal distribution,\n",
    "it simplifies statistical calculations and allows for the application of various parametric tests.\n",
